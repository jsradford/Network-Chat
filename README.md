# Network-Chat
Template for creating a networked chat room in Volunteer Science.

You can add this code directly into any study on Volunteer Science and it will work. If you are combining it with another study, you will have to move the setupChatChannels function into your existing initialize() function.  

You can also find this study as a template within Volunteer Science under the Add new/Clone Experiment menu.
